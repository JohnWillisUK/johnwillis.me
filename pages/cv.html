<h2>John Willis </h2>

<h3>DevOps Engineer</h3>
<p>2019 - Present </p>

<p>As a DevOps Engineer I help to transform the ways of working in the General Insurance space. I work to incorporate <em>new</em> technologies, tools and processes in order to deliver real-world benefits safely, but at pace. I look at future tech and trends and look for opportunities to bring these into the lab and keep the digital stack moving forwards.</p>
<p>DevOps is an area I really enjoy as it compliments my inquisitive nature. Some of the technologies I have had the opportunities to work with in this position include: Splunk, Selenium and Power BI alongside various cloud providers including GCP, Azure and IBM. </p>
<h3>Software Test Lead</h3>
<p>2009 - 2019 </p>

<p>Managing a team of ten onshore colleagues with a further fifteen offshore partners my role included defining a test strategy, project and stakeholder management as well as Line and task management duties.</p>
<p>I believe my greatest achievements in this role include overseeing the testing and delivery of four, new, accessible and responsive stockbroking websites as well as mentoring numerous colleagues and helping them to further their careers.</p>
