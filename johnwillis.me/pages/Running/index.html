                <!-- add your 150 word maximum About Me content here -->
                <p>Run director, endurance runner, slow runner and cake aficionado – just a few of the things I like to think I am. I’m John Willis and across this site I wish to portray to you my love of Running and the awesome things that come with it.</p>
                
                <p>I first
                     found a love of running at school running cross country in a club known as the ‘160 club’. The purpose of the club was to challenge yourself to run 160km (100 miles) within 5 years. </p>

                <p>After a break from running that lasted 16 years, I have regained that love and in 2021 I plan to run a minimum 160km in a 24 hours event: <a href="https://www.endure24.co.uk/">Endure 24</a>.
                You can find me in all the coolest running spots including: <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2142115">Strava</a>, <a href="https://www.runbritainrankings.com/runners/profile.aspx?athleteid=347392">Run Britain</a> rankings as well as my popular Instagram page - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/runandeatcake/?hl=en">@Runandeatcake</a>.</p>

                <h2>My running world</h2>
                <!-- add your 250 word maximum topic content here -->
                <p> As a non-runner you could easily look at runners and think that all there is to running is putting one foot in front of the other. While that could be true - in my experience it couldn’t be further from the Truth. Running as a hobby for me includes volunteering, eating cake, friends, helping my community and occasionally putting one foot in front of the other.

            <li>  <h3>parkrun</h3>
            <p>My first parkrun was on 5th June 2010, I then went seven years before the bug bit me. I have now ran 55 times and volunteered on 49 occasions. I’ve been a run director at <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/selby/">Selby parkrun</a> for 3 years and an event director at <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/braytonacademy-juniors/">Brayton Academy junior parkrun</a> for 6 months.</p></li>
            <li> <h3>Selby Striders</h3>
            <p>  <a href="https://www.selbystriders.org.uk/">Selby Striders</a>
                is my local run club who I have ran with for around 3 years. When I first joined, I was new to the area and knew no one. I now am part of a massive community of runners and this is massively thanks to the Striders.</p></li>
                <li> <h3>Vale of York Athletics Club (VoYAC)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.valeofyork.com/"> VoYAC</a> is a relatively new club I’m getting involved with based in Selby. At VoYAC we offer structured training based around the 80/20 training method and I’ll be training here with one eye on my aspiration of 160 km in 24 hours next summer.</p></li>
        <li><h3> Ultra-Marathons</h3>
            <p> My favourite runs are ultras marathons – this basically means any run further than 26.2 miles (26.2 miles is the distance of a marathon). But more on my endurance runs below.</p></li>

                              <p>My first ever Ultra Marathon was at an event known as ‘Hell on the Humber’ which involves laps across The Humber Bridge. I was so proud to accomplish 33 miles at this event which had a 9 hour cut-off, with me finishing in 8h 45m. I found ultras much more my style in comparison with Marathons. I learned focus is on mind-over-matter and learning to live with the pain in order to be successful in such an event. Another key skill I picked up was consuming the calories necessary in order to keep you going.</p>

                              <p>I obtained my furthest ever distance – 60 miles, at my favourite event ‘Endure 24’. Based in Brahmam, Leeds, this event gives you 24 hours to see how far you can run. Thousands of athletes line up and run in teams of between 2 – 10 runners. But around 400 go solo and learn about themselves and their limits in an absolute all out battle with the mind and body. The emotions at an event such as this are incredible with massive highs and horrendous lows. Blood, sweat and tears are all but guaranteed.</p>

                              <p>2020 was a terrible year for running with almost all events cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. In June, in lieu of Endure24 I took part in Virtual Endure24, raising money for the NHS and running. This was to date my most recent ultra and I managed to complete 50 miles running from my village to the next multiple times. In true Endure style it was a 24 hour race. This year as a treat I even managed to eat cake and drink Beer during my run. Although different, it was thoroughly enjoyable. </p>
